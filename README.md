## 🔑 Key Moments That Shaped My Craft

My creative process is deeply rooted in observation, service, and personal evolution. The systems I design are born not just from technical skill, but from lived realities — moments that challenged me, moved me, and ultimately shaped the kind of developer I strive to be.

| Experience | Influence |
|------------|-----------|
| **Daily runs through passionate routes — Kibera, Toi Market, forgotten footpaths** | These runs exposed me to both the grit and poetry of underserved communities. They became more than exercise — they became research, reflection, and the emotional fuel behind *Word and Learn*, a platform blending storytelling, equity, and digital learning for children. |
| **Caretaker moments during my time as a school medical prefect** | Leading health responses taught me speed, calm under pressure, and empathy. These principles shaped *HeartCall*, an emergency system built not just for functionality, but for the people experiencing crisis. |
| **Personal encounters with insecurity and theft** | Having lived through high-stakes loss, including the theft of my laptop and near-mugging, I developed *SecureMe*, a surveillance and crime prediction tool grounded in the urgent need for safer environments. |
| **Professional immersion in Africa’s child protection systems** | As the sole frontend engineer and designer of the UNICEF-powered *OPENCHS*, I’ve helped build tools trusted by helplines across Kenya (116), Uganda (SautiCall), and Tanzania (C-Sema). It taught me to design for scale, clarity, and dignity. |
| **The rhythm of poetry and prose in quiet evenings** | Writing has always been my second language. I use it to reflect on society, synthesize learning, and communicate complexity with simplicity. This discipline of clarity echoes in every line of code and every user interface. |
| **Pan-African tech communities and global AI conversations** | Through *IndabaX Kenya* and *Deep Learning Indaba 2025*, I’ve been mentored and mentored others — reinforcing that African solutions require both local understanding and global-level execution. |
